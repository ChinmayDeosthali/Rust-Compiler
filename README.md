# Project_1
Write a simple compiler in Rust. 

## Objective
Compiler is one of the core software in our system software stack. A vulnerable compiler can instrument malicious instruction in a binary. A compiler has two phases: front-end and back-end. In this project, we will write a simple compiler that will
- read a code using stdin
- tokenize the source (lexical analysis)
- check correctness of code (syntax analysis)
- generate a parse tree

# Programming Language used
Rust

# How to run
###### once the compilation is successful, run the following command
> cargo run path/to/file/filename.cpp
> eg: > cargo run input_dir/inp1.cpp
###### The above command will automatically compile the rust compiler code and then it will run the compiler using filename.c as an input.
